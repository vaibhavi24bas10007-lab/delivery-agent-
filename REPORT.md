# Autonomous Delivery Agent System - Technical Report

## 1. Environment Model

### Grid Representation
The system uses a 2D grid environment where each cell represents a location in the city. The grid supports:
- **Static obstacles**: Buildings that are impassable
- **Terrain costs**: Different movement costs for various terrain types
- **Dynamic obstacles**: Moving vehicles with deterministic schedules

### Terrain Types and Costs
- **Road**: Cost 1 (fastest movement)
- **Grass**: Cost 2 (moderate movement)
- **Water**: Cost 3 (slower movement)
- **Mountain**: Cost 4 (slowest movement)
- **Building**: Impassable (infinite cost)

### Movement Model
- 4-connected movement (up, down, left, right)
- Agent can move one cell per time step
- Movement cost depends on terrain type
- Dynamic obstacles can block paths and require replanning

## 2. Agent Design

### Core Components
- **State Management**: Tracks position, time, fuel, and package status
- **Task Management**: Handles multiple delivery tasks with priorities
- **Planning Module**: Selects and executes search algorithms
- **Replanning System**: Detects path invalidity and triggers replanning

### Planning Strategies
The agent supports six different planning strategies:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at current depth
2. **Uniform-Cost Search**: Explores nodes in order of increasing path cost
3. **A* with Manhattan Distance**: Informed search with admissible heuristic
4. **A* with Euclidean Distance**: Informed search with less informed heuristic
5. **Hill-Climbing**: Local search with random restarts
6. **Simulated Annealing**: Probabilistic local search with temperature cooling

## 3. Search Algorithms

### Uninformed Search
- **BFS**: Guarantees optimal solution for unweighted graphs
- **Uniform-Cost Search**: Guarantees optimal solution for weighted graphs

### Informed Search
- **A***: Uses heuristic function to guide search toward goal
  - Manhattan distance: `|x1-x2| + |y1-y2|` (admissible for 4-connected grid)
  - Euclidean distance: `√((x1-x2)² + (y1-y2)²)` (admissible but less informed)

### Local Search
- **Hill-Climbing**: Greedy local search with random restarts to escape local optima
- **Simulated Annealing**: Probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions to explore solution space

## 4. Dynamic Replanning

### Replanning Triggers
- Path becomes invalid due to moving obstacles
- Agent reaches end of current path
- New tasks are added

### Replanning Process
1. Detect path invalidity
2. Clear current path
3. Replan using current strategy
4. Continue execution

## 5. Experimental Results

### Test Maps
- **Small (10x10)**: Basic obstacles and terrain
- **Medium (20x20)**: More complex terrain patterns
- **Large (50x50)**: Multiple building clusters
- **Dynamic (15x15)**: Moving obstacles with different patterns

### Performance Metrics
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of problems solved
- **Path Cost**: Total cost of solution path
- **Nodes Expanded**: Number of nodes explored during search
- **Planning Time**: Time taken to find solution
- **Replanning Events**: Number of times agent had to replan

### Expected Results
Based on algorithm characteristics:

1. **A* with Manhattan Distance**: Best overall performance
   - High success rate
   - Optimal or near-optimal solutions
   - Reasonable planning time

2. **Uniform-Cost Search**: Good for cost optimization
   - Guaranteed optimal solutions
   - Higher node expansion than A*
   - Slower planning time

3. **BFS**: Good for unweighted problems
   - High success rate on simple problems
   - Poor performance on weighted graphs
   - Fast planning time

4. **Local Search Methods**: Variable performance
   - May not find solutions consistently
   - Fast when they work
   - Good for large problem spaces

## 6. Analysis and Conclusions

### When Each Method Performs Better

**A* with Manhattan Distance**:
- Best for most delivery scenarios
- Optimal balance of solution quality and planning time
- Excellent for dynamic environments with replanning

**Uniform-Cost Search**:
- Best when solution optimality is critical
- Good for fuel-constrained scenarios
- Slower but guaranteed optimal

**BFS**:
- Best for simple, unweighted pathfinding
- Fast execution on small maps
- Poor performance on complex terrain

**Local Search Methods**:
- Best for very large problem spaces
- Good when planning time is critical
- May fail on complex constraint problems

### Key Insights

1. **Heuristic Quality Matters**: Manhattan distance provides better guidance than Euclidean distance for grid-based pathfinding.

2. **Replanning is Essential**: Dynamic environments require robust replanning capabilities to handle moving obstacles.

3. **Strategy Selection**: Different scenarios benefit from different planning strategies based on problem characteristics.

4. **Scalability**: A* provides the best balance of performance and scalability across different problem sizes.

### Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Automatically choose planning strategy based on problem characteristics
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Handle multiple delivery agents simultaneously
3. **Uncertainty Handling**: Deal with unpredictable obstacle movement
4. **Real-time Optimization**: Continuous optimization during execution
