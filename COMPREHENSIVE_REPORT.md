# Autonomous Delivery Agent System - Comprehensive Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the design, implementation, and experimental analysis of an autonomous delivery agent system that navigates a 2D grid city environment to deliver packages. The system demonstrates multiple pathfinding algorithms, dynamic replanning capabilities, and comprehensive performance analysis across different environment configurations.

## 1. Environment Model

### 1.1 Grid Representation
The system uses a 2D grid-based environment where:
- **Grid Cells**: Integer coordinates (x, y) with varying terrain types
- **Movement**: 4-connected movement (up, down, left, right)
- **Constraints**: Grid cells have movement costs ≥ 1 based on terrain type

### 1.2 Terrain Types and Costs
| Terrain Type | Movement Cost | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Road | 1 | Fastest movement path |
| Grass | 2 | Moderate difficulty |
| Water | 3 | Difficult terrain |
| Mountain | 4 | Very difficult terrain |
| Building | ∞ | Impassable obstacles |

### 1.3 Dynamic Obstacles
- **Moving Vehicles**: Deterministic movement patterns with known schedules
- **Temporal Planning**: Agent can predict future obstacle positions
- **Replanning**: Automatic path adjustment when obstacles block current route

## 2. Agent Design

### 2.1 Rational Decision Making
The agent maximizes delivery efficiency under constraints:
- **Primary Goal**: Complete all delivery tasks
- **Constraints**: Limited fuel, time pressure, dynamic obstacles
- **Strategy Selection**: Adaptive planning based on problem characteristics

### 2.2 State Representation
```python
AgentState = {
    position: Position(x, y),
    time: int,
    fuel: float,
    carrying_packages: List[str],
    completed_deliveries: List[str]
}
```

### 2.3 Planning Strategies
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at current depth
2. **Uniform-Cost Search**: Explores nodes in order of increasing path cost
3. **A* with Manhattan Distance**: Informed search with admissible heuristic
4. **A* with Euclidean Distance**: Alternative heuristic for different scenarios
5. **Hill Climbing**: Local search with random restarts
6. **Simulated Annealing**: Probabilistic local search with temperature cooling

## 3. Search Algorithms and Heuristics

### 3.1 Uninformed Search Methods

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Approach**: Explores nodes level by level
- **Optimality**: Optimal for unweighted graphs
- **Completeness**: Guaranteed to find solution if one exists
- **Time Complexity**: O(b^d) where b is branching factor, d is depth
- **Space Complexity**: O(b^d)

#### Uniform-Cost Search
- **Approach**: Explores nodes in order of increasing path cost
- **Optimality**: Optimal for weighted graphs
- **Completeness**: Guaranteed complete
- **Best Use Case**: When path cost optimization is critical

### 3.2 Informed Search Methods

#### A* with Manhattan Distance Heuristic
- **Heuristic**: h(n) = |x₁ - x₂| + |y₁ - y₂|
- **Admissibility**: Always ≤ actual cost (admissible)
- **Informedness**: More informed than Euclidean for grid-based movement
- **Optimality**: Guaranteed optimal with admissible heuristic

#### A* with Euclidean Distance Heuristic
- **Heuristic**: h(n) = √((x₁ - x₂)² + (y₁ - y₂)²)
- **Admissibility**: Admissible but less informed than Manhattan
- **Best Use Case**: When diagonal movement is allowed

### 3.3 Local Search Methods

#### Hill Climbing with Random Restarts
- **Approach**: Greedy local optimization with escape mechanisms
- **Restart Strategy**: Random restarts to avoid local optima
- **Random Walk**: Probabilistic exploration to escape plateaus
- **Best Use Case**: Large search spaces where global optimum is less critical

#### Simulated Annealing
- **Approach**: Probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions
- **Temperature Schedule**: Gradual cooling to balance exploration/exploitation
- **Acceptance Probability**: P = exp(-ΔE/T)
- **Best Use Case**: Complex optimization landscapes

## 4. Dynamic Replanning Strategy

### 4.1 Replanning Triggers

5. **Path Execution**: Continue with new path

### 4.3 Performance Optimization
- **Path Caching**: Cache frequently used paths
